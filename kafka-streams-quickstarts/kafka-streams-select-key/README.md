# Kafka Streams Select Key

This module demonstrates the following:

- The usage of the Processor API, including `selectKey()` and `peek()`.
- Unit testing using the Topology Test Driver.

In this module, records of type `<String, KafkaPerson>` are streamed from a topic named `PERSON_TOPIC`.
The following tasks are performed:

1. Selects the last name of each record as the new key.
2. Writes the resulting records into a new topic named `PERSON_SELECT_KEY_TOPIC`.
