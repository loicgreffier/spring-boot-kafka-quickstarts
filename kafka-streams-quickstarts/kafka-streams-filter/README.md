# Kafka Streams Filter

This module demonstrates the following:

- The use of the Kafka Streams DSL, including `filter()`, `filterNot()` and `peek()`.
- Unit testing using Topology Test Driver.

In this module, records of type `<String, KafkaUser>` are streamed from a topic named `USER_TOPIC`.
The following tasks are performed:

1. Apply a filter to only keep the `KafkaUser` records where the last name starts with the letter `S` and the first name starts with the letter `H`.
2. Write the resulting filtered records to a new topic named `USER_FILTER_TOPIC`.

## Prerequisites

To compile and run this demo, youâ€™ll need:

- Java 21
- Maven
- Docker

## Running the Application

To run the application manually:

- Start a [Confluent Platform](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/quickstart/ce-docker-quickstart.html#step-1-download-and-start-cp) in a Docker environment.
- Produce records of type `<String, KafkaUser>` to a topic named `USER_TOPIC`. You can use the [producer user](../specific-producers/kafka-streams-producer-user) to do this.
- Start the Kafka Streams application.

To run the application in Docker, use the following command:

```console
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will start the following services in Docker:

- 1 Kafka broker (KRaft mode)
- 1 Schema Registry
- 1 Control Center
- 1 producer User
- 1 Kafka Streams Filter
