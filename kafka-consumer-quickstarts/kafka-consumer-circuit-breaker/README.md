# Consumer Circuit Breaker

This module demonstrates the following:

- How to use the Kafka Clients consumer API.
- How to work with Apache Avro.
- Unit testing with a mock consumer.

This module performs the following tasks:

- Consume records of type `<String, KafkaUser>` from a topic named `USER_TOPIC`.
- Handles deserialization exceptions and seeks past the poison pill.
- If a poison pill is found in the middle of a batch of valid records, the `poll()` method will return the good records in the first loop, then throw the deserialization exception in the second
- To ensure no valid records are lost, the module seeks to the next offset.

## Prerequisites

To compile and run this demo, youâ€™ll need:

- Java 21
- Maven
- Docker

## Running the Application

To run the application manually:

- Start a [Confluent Platform](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/quickstart/ce-docker-quickstart.html#step-1-download-and-start-cp) in a Docker environment.
- Produce records of type `<String, KafkaUser>` to a topic named `USER_TOPIC`. You can use the [Producer Avro Specific](../../kafka-producer-quickstarts/kafka-producer-avro-specific) to do this.
- Intentionally trigger a deserialization exception by either:
    - Deleting the Avro schema from the schema registry.
    - Producing a String message in the middle of Avro messages.
- Start the consumer.

To run the application in Docker, use the following command:

```console
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will start the following services in Docker:

- 1 Kafka Broker (KRaft mode)
- 1 Schema Registry
- 1 Control Center
- 1 producer Avro Specific
- 1 Circuit Breaker Consumer
